## AfCFTA Ex-ante Analysis

Replication package for the EMJMD-EGEI dissertation titled **"An Ex-ante Evaluation of the Economic Impact of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) on ex-ante evaluation of AfCFTA economic impacts"** authored by **Jamiu Olamilekan Badmus** and supervised by **Prof. Ruben Dewitte** - Economist at the economic research team of ING and visiting professor at Ghent University, Belgium. 

## Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for the ex-ante evaluation of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) agreement's economic impacts. The replicator should expect the whole code to run for about 2 to 3 days.

## Computing environment

This code was run on a x86_64-w64-mingw32 platform of a Windows 10 x64 (build 26100) computer. 

The analysis is conducted in the R programming environment. R is free, open-source and available for download here: https://www.r-project.org/. The code has been tested against R version 4.5.1 (2025-06-13 ucrt).

Once R is successfully set up on your system, you will need to install a number of external R libraries. I have provided the code to install all the necessary R libraries in each of the R scripts.

## Instructions to replicators

The empirical data analysis takes place within the ./input, /code, and ./output directories respectively holding the external files, the code that operates on the files in the ./input directory, and the computational results. 

Further files and directories refer to: 

- The Readme files ./Readme.md, ./Readme.html, and ./Readme.docx are generated by ./Readme.Rmd. **NOTE: It's fine if your write your Readme file in Word!**
- The  ./afcfta_milestone_timeline.png and ./tralac_2024.png files are pictures that show the time phase of AfCFTA agreement and the map of countries that has signed and/or ratified the agreement, respectively.  

## Methodology

This research uses Poisson Pseudo-Maximum Likelihood (PPML) estimations and structural gravity modeling to evaluate the trade and welfare effects of AfCFTA.
